1. Go to locale and run install.sh

   cd locale
   ./install.sh

2. (Optional) Open /etc/locale.alias and make sure si and
   si_LK entries are in alphabetically correct place.

3. Install the font lklug.otf.  See fonts/README.fonts for
   step by step instructions.

4. Go to po/ directory and run si.sh (this needs German
   language support to be already installed).

   cd po/
   ./si.sh

5. If your Pango version is older than 1.8.0, upgrade to
   1.8.0 or higher

   OR

   recompile pango for your system using patches in
   gtk/pango.  Creating DEB and RPM packages are
   explained in doc/README.deb and doc/README.rpm.

6. Install gtk keyboard method in gtk/im/.  Running autogen.sh
   (step 2) is not necessary if the `configure' script is
   already there.

   cd gtk/im/
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   su -c make install
   make clean

7. Recompile qt after installing patches in qt/im/.  Read
   qt/im/README for more details.  Warning!!!  This breaks
   binary compatibility of qt, so all the dependent packages
   such as KDE needs compiling. :-(
