WARNING!!!  Compiling qt with -inputmethod-ext breaks binary
compatibility, so you need to recompile all the dependent
applications including the complete KDE suite. :-(

So please don't try this unless you know what you are doing!!!

- Get the qt-im patch (20040910) from:

  http://immodule-qt.freedesktop.org/Software/ImmoduleQtDownload

- Go to the QT source directory:

  cd qt-x11-free-3.3.3/

- Apply the qt-im patch (this is -p0 patch):

  zcat qt-x11-immodule-unified-qt3.3.3-20040910.diff.gz | patch -p0

- Apply the surrounding text support patch:

  patch -p1 < qt-3.3.3-im-surround.patch

- Apply the Sinhala im patch:

  patch -p1 < qt-3.3.3-im-sinhala.patch

- Apply the script engine fix patch.  It is in qt/ directory:

  patch -p1 < qt-3.3.3-script-engine-sinhala-1.patch

- Make sure qt is configured with the options -inputmethod
  and -inputmethod-ext.
  
  Gentoo users can do this by setting immqt USE variable.
  This will automatically apply the qt-im patch, so they have
  to bypass the first patch.

  Debian users can get the source with `apt-get source',
  apply the patches, and edit debian/rules file to add
  configure options.

  RPM users can apply the patch and recreate the tarball (read
  doc/README.rpm) after applying the patches, and edit the spec
  file to add the configure options.
