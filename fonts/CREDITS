The outlines of this font are from the Sinhala LaTeX pagkage:

  http://www.ocs.mq.edu.au/~vsaparam/sinhala.html

Quoted from the README of that package:

  "This is a package of Metafont fonts and a preprocessor
  suitable for writing Sinhala script using TeX or LaTeX.  This
  package was originally developed by Yannis Haralambous
  (Yannis.Haralambous at univ-lille1 fr), with funding from the
  Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, 183 Euston
  Road, London NW1 2BE, England (Contact person: Dominik
  Wujastyk (D.Wujastyk at ucl ac uk)), which is using the font
  in its Catalogue of Sinhala Manuscript. The original package
  was available by ftp at ftp.bcc.ac.uk in:

  /pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software/sinhala1-TeX.zip

  It was later modified by Vasantha Saparamadu (vsaparam at ocs
  mq edu au) to add support for 'samanala' transliteration
  scheme developed by Prasad Dharmasena (pkd at isr umd edu)."

LKLUG OpenType font was created by Anuradha Ratnaweera of Virtusa
Corporation (anuradha at gnu org) and Harshani Devadithya using the
outlines of the above font and adding GSUB table entries.
"Kunddaliya" glyph added and OTF tables modified by Harshula Jayasuriya
(harshula at gmail dot com)

The LKLUG font was created completely using FontForge
(http://fontforge.sourceforge.net).
