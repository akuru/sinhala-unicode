Get the sinhala Tex package from http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/sinhala/ and install it. You do not need the indica preprocessor. It is sufficient to install the sinhala Metafont fonts and the sinhala.sty file in proper places.

Installing sintex
=================
tar zxvf sintex_0.01.tar.gz
cd sintex_0.01
make

This will create the sintex binary. Note that you need flex in your system to create the sintex preprocessor.

Using sintex
============

sintex < example.sin > example.tex
latex example.tex
