Debian
------

* If you are running woody, add ONE of the following lines to
  /etc/apt/sources.list

    deb http://mirror.raw.no/ gnome2.2/
    deb http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/mirrors.evilgeniuses.org.uk/debian/backports/woody gnome2.2/

  and run

    apt-get update
    apt-get dist-upgrade

  to get gnome 2.2. Sarge and sid users don't have to do this step.

* Add the line

    deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main non-free contrib

  to /etc/apt/sources.list, update source and get pango sources

    apt-get update
    cd /usr/local/src/
    apt-get source pango1.0

* Go to the pango source directory and unpack the source

    cd pango1.0-1.2.5/upstream/tarballs/
    tar -xzvf 000_pango-1.2.5.tar.gz

* Apply the sinhala patch to the source

    cd pango-1.2.5/
    patch -p1 < /wherever/is/pango-1.2.5-sinhala.patch

* Recreate the tarball with the patched source

    cd ..
    tar -czvf 000_pango-1.2.5.tar.gz pango-1.2.5/

* Build the binary deb package

   cd ../..
   dpkg-buildpackage -b

  If the build fails, read the last error message and installing missing packages
  such as libgtk2.0-dev should fix the problem.
  
  Deb packages are created in /usr/local/src/.

* Install the deb packages

    cd ..
    dpkg -i *pango*deb


RedHat
------

(WARNING: File names may be slightly different)

* Get the pango source rpm for your distribution and install it (me and Ruwan
  found one from one of the `rpm find' sites).

    rpm -i pango-1.2.5.src.rpm

  This will install the source tarball to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
  and spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/

* Untar the SOURCE tree. 

    cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
    tar -xzvf pango-1.2.5.tar.gz

* Apply the patch

    cd pango-1.2.5/
    patch -p1 < /wherever/is/pango-1.2.5-sinhala.patch

* Recreate the tarball with the patched source

    cd ..
    tar -czvf pango-1.2.5.tar.gz pango-1.2.5/

* On newer RH systems, install rpmbuild package and
  build the binary RPM

   cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
   rpmbuild -bb pango-1.2.5.spec

  On older RH systems, use rpm command itself instead of rpmbuild.

  If the build fails, read the last error message and installing missing packages
  such gtk-devel (?) should fix it.
  
  RPM packages are created in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/.

* Install the RPM packages:

    cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/
    rpm -Uvh *pango*rpm
