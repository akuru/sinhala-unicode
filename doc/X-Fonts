Copy all your fonts to a custom location, normally
/usr/local/share/fonts.  They have to be added to
two different font systems.

XFT
---

This is the new system

* If you have /etc/fonts/local.conf, add the line

    <dir>/usr/local/share/fonts</dir>

  If local.conf is not there, add this line to /etc/fonts/fonts.conf.

* See if the font is in X by running

    fc-list

  and grepping for the relevent font (may be with an -i)

* If the font is not found, try running

    fc-cache -v -f

  as root.

* You do NOT have to restart X (good news).

X core
------

* Create fonts.scale and fonts.dir files

    cd /usr/local/share/fonts/
    /usr/bin/X11/mkfontscale
    /usr/bin/X11/mkfontsdir

  (If you are running and old XFree86 version, mkfontscale may
  not be available.  Just grab the mkfontscale.c file from
  one of the cvsweb sites and compile it with cc.  However, OTF
  files may not be recognized by old XFree86 systems.)

* If you are using a font server, add /usr/local/share/fonts to
  "catalogue" variable, and restart font server.

    /etc/init.d/xfs restart

* If you are not using a font server, add the line

    FontPath  "/usr/local/fonts"

  to the "Files" section of /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
  and restart X.

* See if the font is available by running

    xlsfonts

  and grepping for the font name (probably with an -i).
