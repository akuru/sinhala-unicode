<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sayura is a quasi-transliteration scheme for Sinhala script.  Unlike
true tansliteration schemes, Sayura uses individual Latin characters to
signify unmodified consonents, and not their "hal" form.  For example,
මම is entered as "mm", and not "mama".</p> 

<a name="history" />
<h3>History</h3>

<p>I wrote the first implementation of Sayura transliterated scheme in
mid 2004 to include in <a
href="http://mail.lug.lk/lurker/thread/20040902.035405.daf12f07.en.html">our
first package</a> (version 0.1 it was called) to enable Sinhala in
GNU/Linux.  It was only for GTK, and not properly named.  For the GTK
part of the implementation, I used some code from another im-module
written by Chamath Keppitiyagama.</p>

<p>Sayura defines context dependant behaviour of keys.  For example, "i"
at the beginning of a word produced "ඉ", after another "i" it converted
"ඉ" to "ඊ", after a consonant it added an ispilla, and after a consonant
with an ispilla, it converted the ispilla to a diga ispilla.  Multiple
use of keys depending on the context allowed us to use fewer keys in
very intuitive ways.</p>

<p>Sayura algorithm internally uses bytes, not UTF-8.  Sinhala code page
is mapped to characters 128-255, and ZWJ and ZWNJ are given 0x0d and
0x0c.</p>

<p>In September 2004, <a
href="http://mail.lug.lk/lurker/message/20040906.132054.53a033be.en.html">I
announced</a> an attempt to port the GTK im-module to QT.  After first
<a
href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/pipermail/immodule-qt/2004-September/000540.html">implementing
surrounding text support</a>, the QT port of the im-module <a
href="http://mail.lug.lk/lurker/thread/20040922.062240.f535d462.en.html">was
announced</a> in late September 2004, and included in <a
href="http://mail.lug.lk/lurker/thread/20040927.053658.514d4128.en.html">Sinhala
GNU/Linux 0.2</a>.</p>

<p>However, my patch to QT broke binary compatibility, so applying it
also required a complete recompile of dependant apps.  Therefore, it was
unlikely to go upstream.  Although <a
href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/pipermail/immodule-qt/2004-September/000554.html">Kazuki
Otta's port</a> made to QT4 upstream, QT3 apps were going to be there
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Typing in OpenOffice was yet to be solved.</p>

<p>In October 2005, there was a Codefest in Colombo as a part of the
Asia OSS conference.  Kazuki Otta <a
href="http://mail.lug.lk/lurker/thread/20051012.062709.e8b18c88.en.html">ported</a>
the GTK module to <a href="http://www.scim-im.org">SCIM</a>.  As SCIM
stands below GTK, QT and OpenOffice and all other X apps, it provided a
unified input mechanism.</p>

<p>The algorithm's dependency on surrounding text support was also
removed.  The package was called "scim-sinhala-trans".</a>

<p>For the next couple of years, scim-sinhala-trans became the primary
input scheme on GNU/Linux systems, and was shipped with some distros
including Fedora/Redhat.  Debs were always available <a
href="http://sinhala.sourceforge.net">here</a>.</p>

<p>In early 2008, S Pravin sent some patches to add preedit support and
other improvements.  I added several tweaks to the Sayura algorithm
itself to preserve old semantics with the new preedit code, and also to
improve in certain places. A key improvement is bringing back
surrounding text support, but only to use it when available.</p>

<p>A development series 0.3.x <a
href="http://mail.lug.lk/lurker/message/20080509.202929.5e581c19.en.html">was
announced</a> in May 2008 to continue and test the new set of
developments, and the scheme was named "Sayura" to distinguish from
other schemes such as <a
href="http://www.ocs.mq.edu.au/~vsaparam/samanala.pdf">Samanala</a> and
<a href="http://www.ruh.ac.lk/Songs/Sumihiri.html">Sumihiri</a>.</p>

<h2>Key Allocation</h2>

<a name="vowels" />
<h3>Vowels</h3>

<p>First, we assigned "a", "e", "i", "o" and "u" to their most obvious
counterparts in Sinhala: "අ", "එ", "ඉ", "ඔ" and "උ".  Remaining basic
vowel "ඇ" was given he key "A" in Sayura version 0.2, but we decided to
also allocate "q" to input "ඇ" in 0.3, because pressing shift to the
common "ඇ" turned out to be counter-productive.</p>

<p>Long wovels are typed by pressing the same key twice.  For example,
"aa" produces "ආ".</p>

<p>"ඓ" and "ඖ" were allocated "I" and "O", and "U" produces long and
short forms of "ඍ".  "අං" and "අඃ" are given "x" and "hH", but from 0.3.1,
we will allocate "Q" also to enter අඃ".</p>

<a name="modifiers" />
<h3>Modifiers</h3>

<p>Modifiers are allocated the same keys as vowels, but effective when
typed after a consonent.  Only difference is that "a" corresponds to "ආ"
instead of "අ".</p>

<p>For example, "kii" produces "කී", while "kU" gives us "කෘ".</p>

<a name="consonants" />
<h3>Consonants</h3>

<p>First we allocated lower case keys to consonents in the most obvious
form: "r", "t", "y", "p", "s", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "c",
"v", "b", "n" and "m" to "ර", "ත", "ය", "ප", "ස", "ද", "ෆ", "ග", "හ",
"ජ", "ක", "ල", "ච", "ව", "බ", "න" and "ම" respectively.</p>

<p>The only arguable allocatoins are "t" and "d".  We think "ත" and "ද"
is more common than "ට" and "ඩ", so decided to risk a few initial
surprises for the sake of long term efficiency.</p>

<p>Upper case letters are used for other consonant forms (e.g.: ඵ, ළ, ණ)
whenever possible.  We also introduced some shortcuts such as "M" for
"ඹ".  As we use "x" for "අං", upper case "X" was assigned "ඞ".</p>

<p>A consonant is converted to mahaprana and sagngnaka by typing upper
case "H" and "G".  But there are shortcuts such as "P" for "ඵ", "G" for
"ඟ" and "M" for "ඹ".</p>

<a name="al" />
<h3>Al Akuru</h3>

<p>We allocated "w", the only unallocated and easy-to-type character,
for al-kireema, and upper case "W" to add a ZWJ to create a joiner.  So,
typing "kwsH" creates "ක්ෂ", while "kWsH" produces joint "ක්‍ෂ".<p>

<p>We also have shortcuts "R" and "Y" to produce "rakaransaya" and
"yansaya".  E.g.: "SRii" produces "ශ්‍රී".</p>

<a name="install" />
<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Latest version of SCIM module is 0.3.3.  Download it <a href="scim-sayura-0.3.3.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to try out the present stable version of Sayura SCIM
module (which is called scim-sinhala-trans), follow the instructions at
<a href="http://sinhala.sourceforge.net">sinhala.sourceforge.net</a>.
However, we encourage you to test 0.3 series, which brings out "preedit"
support and improvements to the scheme itself.</p>

<h3>DEB based systems</h3>
<p>On Debian based systems, make a DEB package:</p>
<pre class="term">
% tar -xzvf scim-sayura-0.3.3.tar.gz
% cd scim-sayura-0.3.3
% dpkg-buildpackage -b
</pre>

<p>If you get a "command not found" error, install the "dpkg-dev" package, and preferably "build-essential" package as well.</p>

<p>If dpkg-buildpackage complains about missing packages, install them
and try again.</p>

<h3>RPM based systems</h3>

<p>Locate your RPM directory, usually in /usr/src/.  Following examples assume /usr/src/rpm.  You also need the 'rpmbuild' tool.</p>

<p>First unpack the tarball to a temporary location, and copy the rpm/scim-sayura.spec file to the SPECS subdirectory in RPM directory.  Copy the tarball into SOURCES subdirectory.</p>

<pre class="term">
# cd /tmp
# tar -xzvf /wherever/is/scim-sayura-0.3.3.tar.gz
# cp scim-sayura-0.3.3/rpm/scim-sayura.spec /usr/src/rpm/SPECS/
# cp /wherever/is/scim-sayura-0.3.3.tar.gz /usr/src/rpm/SOURCES/
</pre>

<p>Now run the rpmbuild command with the -bb options to build a binary RPM inside RPMS subdirectory.</p>

<pre class="term">
# cd /usr/src/rpm/SPECS/
# rpmbuild -bb scim-sayura.spec
</pre>
