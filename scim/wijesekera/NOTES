Notes:
1.
(What I call) modifier keys such as paa pilla, aela pilla etc are only allowed after a primary key is pressed. This is because (as far as I know) once text
has been commited, SCIM engines can't change it. If modifiers were allowed,
කෙ + ා would give කො (this is actually 3 characters) not කො (which is 2).

2.
Make sure SCIM is selected as the input method and not piped through
the x input method. This is because the latter gives unpredictable results.
Besides, the scim documentation discourages the x input approach.

3.
This layout conforms to the Sri Lanka Standard 1134 Revision 2: 2004 with
the following exceptions which are left to be done:
 - Repaya ('\') - I'll look for a text sample with this character
 - Touching Letters ('\') - any samples?
 - non breaking space (shift-space) - any samples?
 - invicible (Alt+Shift+Space) - any samples?
 - and the character that looks like grass :-) (alt -gr') - This one I don't see
  in the character map app.

4.
Third level shift is Alt+Shift. I have been told that Alt must be used instead,
but this raises an issue with applications that have menus that conflict with
valid input keys. Maybe someone can clarify the official position regarding
the 3rd level shift.
