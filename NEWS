Release Notes for 0.2
=====================

GTK/GNOME
---------

GTK keyboard input was improved substantially in terms of
usability, the most visible being the use of <F12> to switch
temporally to Latin input.  Pango patch was not changed, but was
ported to more versions.  GTK/GNOME rendering and keyboard input
can be considered fairly stable now.

QT/KDE
------

QT has a critical bug which prevented rendering certain
combinations of characters (e.g.: kanthoruwa) wrong.  A patch is
included in 0.2 which fixes this in the QT script engine.  It
also has a patch to add surround text support to QT, and a
Sinhala keyboard input module, which works very similar to the
GTK input module.

These three changes to QT makes its Sinhala support almost
perfect.  The bad news is that they break binary compatibility,
so one has to recompile all the applications that depend on QT,
and certain KDE applications don't work out of the box, although
QT has been fixed.

Spell Checking
--------------

An Aspell dictionary for Sinhala has been added.  The word list
(si.wl) included in this release is small, but a large one is
expected soon.

Samples
-------

A small utility (kavi) is included to format Sinhala poetry, and
the release comes with few samples.
